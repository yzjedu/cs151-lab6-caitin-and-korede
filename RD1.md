In this lab, as well as the previous lab, our goal was to make a program that simulated an ATM, 
complete with error checking and consistent looping to make sure that the user completes all the tasks they
need to, however, we needed to do so utilizing functions instead of just one big block of code. Since a lot of the
groundwork was laid out, it was easy to at least understand what was needed, but executing it could get a little strange.
Every function at the surface level is really easy to understand and complete, but we got a few errors along the way. I 
started the algorithm and got most of the organization done with that quickly, so a lot of the code (mostly done by Caitlin)
went pretty smoothly. The main points we hit roadblocks with were trying to get the withdrawal and deposit functions to stop
if the user inputted a negative number. At first, we made it loop until we remembered that it wasn't what was necessary, so we
had to find a way to make it stop. My solution was to return 1 in case the inputted number was negative so that the program
would know to stop and return 0 if the number wasn't negative and tell the function to keep going. That was probably the
weirdest hurdle to overcome because it felt like the solution should've been easy, but it wasn't. I feel like this lab helped me
gain a better understanding of using functions. I never really connected them with variables but this helped me see them more
as that which made the lab easier.
