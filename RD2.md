# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Caitlin Burns
* Partner Full Name: Korede Oni
* Student ID: 1903398. 

* The goal of this lab was to learn how to use functions in code, as well as in an algorithm. We first created an algorithm for our code, and then we programmed it using functions. The key concept we explored was the functions. Our results did match what we expected to get becuse they matched the results of our last lab. The challenge I encountered was understanding the functions, but once we started working I got a better idea of what functions were and how they should be used. My key takeaway is that functions can be really helpful in programming. I liked working with my partner because he is really good at coding and he was very helpful.
